# 1.2.1 

> Compatibility: EVA < 2.4.0

!!! warning

    To get the files from this version visit the [1.2.1](https://github.com/EVA-3D/easy-mod/tree/1.2.1/docs/stls) tag on GitHub.

This version gives back the Y space that Easy Mod originally stole. To regain that Y one needs to do one of two things:

1. use the included `bed_corner` parts that move the bed -10mm in Y
2. move the whole gantry -10mm in Y (this will be difficult on 3 axis V-core)

I used those `bed_corner` parts for a very long time on my V-core - nothing melted (PETG).

## Upgrade from 1.2.0

The `xy_joiner` parts did not change. The `corner` and `bed` parts are new.

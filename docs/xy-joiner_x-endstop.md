title: Shufflez's V-Core Pro 1.3 y-idler x-endstop

> Created by: Shufflez

## Description
I'm running pre 2.0 EasyMod (RatRigs V-Core 1.3=> upgrade kit), with the 'flat' XY-joiner.
Didn't want endstop on my carriage and got fed-up with sensorless homing.
So whipped up a quick and (very, very) dirty Y-idler X-endstop mount :).
At least it gets me printing.

Fits the [Genmitsu CNC-endstops](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Genmitsu-Switch-3018-PROVER-3018-MX3-3018-PROVer/dp/B08P1D6WTR).
There's room for the pins on backside and about 20mm of adjustability (using with extended EasyMod's endstop-trigger-push-thingy on EVA carriage).

## Compatible EasyMod version
1.2.1 I think.

## Print instructions
Print it so that the 'legs' are flat on the bed. I printed in all perimeters.

# Easy Mod

"Easy Mod" is a modification for the Rat Rig V-core Pro printer. Enables V-core Pro to use the [EVA platform](https://main.eva-3d.page){target=_blank}.

Up to Easy Mod 1.2.1 there is no additional hardware required to use Easy Mod on V-core Pro. Scroll down for more information about the specific versions and what's planned for the future.

### Printing

You can print the parts with 0.2mm or even 0.3mm layer height. Use 4 perimeters to make them strong (~1.8mm wall width), infill is not that important - 20% will be fine. **No supports needed**.

<div 
    class="cloudimage-360"
    data-folder="../assets/print_orientation/"
    data-filename="{index}.png"
    data-amount="36"
    data-speed="500"
    data-control-reverse="true"
    data-full-screen="true"
    data-magnifier="true"
    data-bottom-circle="true"
    data-hide-360-logo="true"
    data-index-zero-base="4"
></div>

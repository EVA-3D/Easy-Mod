# Rat Rig V-core Pro "Easy Mod"

## What this is

Nothing on it's own really - nice selling point I know - but this is a part of a bigger project - the base to use the **[EVA](https://github.com/pkucmus/EVA/) carriage platform** is one example.

The files are in the stl directory, you can download them all as a zip file [here](https://github.com/pkucmus/EVA/archive/master.zip).

## Variants

### 2 Z rails

This is the one I'm currently using, because you need to shorter than the original Z rails (400mm) you need to support them properly so one for each side you'll need:

- 460mm 2020 that goes along the Y axis, under the Y rails
- around 359mm 2020 for the Z axis support of the Z rail, this does not have to be exact and depends on how much space your motors leave you

### 3 Z rails

This variant will probably be easier to achieve but it's a work in progress.
